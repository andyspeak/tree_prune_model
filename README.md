# tree_prune_model

This R code is a simple model for initiating a starting population of urban trees and modelling the changes in tree biomass taking into account pruning rates, pruning frequencies and mortality rates.  The variables for the model have come from real data for 8 tree species in the cities of Taranto and Florence, Italy.

The model is part of the data analysis for the research paper: Speak, A.F., Salbitano, F. (2022) "The impact of pruning and mortality on the provision of urban tree ecosystem services"
